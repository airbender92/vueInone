[$& reg](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4688730/what-does-in-str-replacespecials-mean)
`$&` represents the entire (sub)string matched by the regex, regardless of capture groups. The replacement result you get is each match in your string being escaped by a literal backslash (represented by \\). Since the regex used here consists only of a character class, "each match" refers to each metacharacter listed in the character class that is matched.

For example, the regex string [abc] will be replaced with \[abc\]:

[ is matched as it occurs in the character class. Represented by $&, replaced with \[

a, b and c are not metacharacters in the character class, so they're ignored

] is matched as it occurs in the character class. Represented by $&, replaced with \]
